# GPS Module

#### Project Overview

The GPS Module project demonstrates how to interface a GPS module with an Arduino Mega to retrieve and display location-based data such as latitude, longitude, and altitude. This project utilizes the SoftwareSerial library to communicate with the GPS module via UART (serial communication). It captures GPS data in the standard NMEA format and parses specific sentences to extract and display location information.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **GPS Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the GPS Module to Arduino Mega:**
   - **TX (Transmit)** of GPS module to **RX (Receive) Pin 10** of Arduino Mega
   - **RX (Receive)** of GPS module to **TX (Transmit) Pin 11** of Arduino Mega
   - **VCC** and **GND** of GPS module to **5V** and **GND** of Arduino Mega, respectively

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure that the Arduino IDE is installed on your computer.
   - Include the SoftwareSerial library for handling serial communication with the GPS module.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the GPS module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud) to view GPS data.
   - Observe the serial monitor for latitude, longitude, and altitude data retrieved from the GPS module.

#### Applications

- **Location Tracking:** Retrieve real-time location data for navigation or tracking applications.
- **Mapping and Geocoding:** Integrate GPS data into mapping software for geographical information.
- **Outdoor Activities:** Monitor position and altitude during outdoor activities such as hiking or flying drones.
- **IoT Applications:** Incorporate GPS for asset tracking or location-based IoT devices.

#### Notes

- Ensure the GPS module has a clear view of the sky for optimal satellite signal reception.
- Modify the code to accommodate different NMEA sentences or additional data fields from your specific GPS module.
- Use additional software tools or APIs to visualize GPS data on maps or store it for further analysis.
